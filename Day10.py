# # **Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) Part 2**

# **Abstraction & Encapsulation**
# 1. Seggregation of any component is known as abstraction.
# 2. There could be any Level of abstraction.
# 3. Hinding the abstraction level is known as encapsulation
# 4. In other word Hiding the implementation detail is known as encapsulation

# **Inheritance**

# **Single Inheritance**
# 1. Single Inheritance is a property where any object inherit it's property from other parent or other supporting class

# for example var define in coolproger get 1st precedence followed by Employee then player class
